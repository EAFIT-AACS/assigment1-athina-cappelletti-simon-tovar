The data to enter will be requested by the console.
The format of the transitions is as follows:

  state symbol1 destination1 symbol2 destination2
  
It will depend on whether the automaton is with two equivalent states,
with inaccessible states or more equivalent states.

    Example: Simple automaton with two equivalent states:
    
    State and its transitions: 0 0 1 1 2
    
    Example: Automaton with inaccessible states
    
    State and its transitions: 0 a 1 b 3
    
    Example: Automaton with more equivalent states
    
    State and its transitions: 0 0 1 1 2
